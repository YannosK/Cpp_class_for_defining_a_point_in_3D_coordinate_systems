# Custom coordinate system class in C++

The current project was given to me as an assignment in a Computer Systems course, in the MSc Control and Computing in the Kapodistrian University of Athens by [G. Latsas](http://www.tomease.phys.uoa.gr/g-latsas.html)

This custom cpp class allows the user to create 3-D points in space and get their values in cartesian, cylindrical and spherical coordinates.

The class and its public methods are well documented in the `coordinates.hpp` file

## Build and Run

Run the script `build_and_run.sh`. The project will be builded by the makefile and then the executable is run
